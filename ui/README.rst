Front-end app
=============

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

Getting started:

* Install npm through your package manager (``emerge``, ``apt-get``, ...)
* Install local dependencies: ``make install-deps``
* Build the app: ``make build``
* Run the app: ``make runserver`` (open your browser to http://localhost:8000/)


Behind the scenes
-----------------

Building:

* All dependencies (including CSS) are installed through ``npm``
* We use a ``Makefile`` for running tasks
* For now, no need for ``gulp`` / ``grunt`` / ...
* We use ``browserify`` to gain access to ``npm``'s ``require()`` syntax
* ``uglify`` handles minification
* Sourcemaps (allow a browser to *decompile* code) are generated by ``exorcist`` and ``uglify``.


TODO
----

* Add CSS and image toolchains
* Move this to the main docs


FAQ
---

How do I add a new dependency?
    * Used inside the app: ``npm install --save <package>``
    * Used for *building* the app: ``npm install --save-dev <package>``
